            <p>A human who partook in cannibalism, which turned him into a monster over time. Naturally skilled at

            <div class="victims">
              <p>Tommy—captured by the wendigo, missing for three days <strong>(compare to Dean in 1.01: Dad’s on a
                  hunting trip and hasn’t been home in a few days).</strong>

              <ul>

            <li>Dean has been raised a hunter: he’s good at tracking, has working knowledge of folklore and monsters,
              and is proficient at research. hunting makes Dean confident and calm</li>
            <li>Sam has also been raised to hunt, but he quit and left the life behind. hunting agitates Sam because
              it’s not what he wants to do</li>
            <li>roy is also a hunter, but his inflexibility and unwillingness to believe in monsters gets him killed.

                    <li>Dean is sympathetic to hailey wanting to help search because he shares her determination to keep

          <div class="allegory">Hailey’s fierce protectiveness of her family sets up Dean’s character as family-oriented

              isolating, and has developed mild psychic powers because of the experience</li>
            <li>Dean connects with lucas on the grounds of losing a parent. he lost his mother when he was young<ul>
                <li>Dean emphasizes being brave in the face of trauma and fear because it’s what their parents would
                  want for them<ul>
                    <li>“i think about that every single day”—implies that Dean is afraid and fearful often, and that

            <li>Dean “you can’t bury the truth. nothing stays buried”<ul>
                <li>this is in response to jake and bill trying to cover up peter’s murder. they literally buried the
                  bike to cover their tracks, and they’ve metaphorically been burying the truth across the years to
                  prevent their actions from being uncovered</li>
                <li>if this episode is about John, then this quote reflects that John himself has a secret which will
                  inevitably come to light. this is later first revealed in 1.21 salvation, when we see that John knows
                  about Sam’s destiny as connected to azazel. season 2 is also about that truth being dug up by force
                  now that John is no longer alive to keep it buried. he wanted Dean to keep the secret but he can’t,
                  and as Sam and Dean both discover the truth about Sam’s fate, they’re drug further into its orbit and
                  tensions grow</li>
                <li>this line is foreshadowing Sam’s destiny, the fact that John knows about it, and that it will be
                  revealed forcefully when tensions are at their highest and lives are at stake<ul>
                    <li>John leaves Sam and Dean to their own devices in season 1 because he caught wind of azazel for
                      the first time. azazel is going around creating a new generation of special children. in this way
                      azazel is paralleled with peter. John also offers himself up to azazel to save Dean’s life in 2.01
                      in my time of dying which reflects jake offering himself to peter to save lucas, who parallels
                      Dean</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

            </li>
          </ul>

          <div class="allegory">Lucas’s trauma from losing his dad reflects Dean’s feelings about losing his mom;
            connecting Dean and lucas allows for Bill and Jake to represent John’s character and infers a lot of John’s
            qualities despite his physical absence.

            <li>matt and larry reconcile at the end of the episode because larry realizes that family is more important
              than his ambitions. matt gives up his interest in bugs<ul>
                <li>this implies that the way to reconcile the differences between Sam and John is for John to give up
                  on his own ambitions (hunting azazel) in favor of being with his family, and that Sam needs to
                  sacrifice his “interest” (his pursuit of independence)<ul>

              their fight</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="allegory">Matt and Larry’s rocky relationship reflects the relationship between Sam and John, and
            reveals that in order for them to reconcile John will have to abandon his quest to find and kill Azazel, and
            that Sam will have to commit to his family and stop trying to escape hunting; the curse of the land reflects
            Sam’s curse and reveals that there is no way to “save” Sam from it.

            </li>
            <li>sam’s anger with john becomes directed at dean at the start of the episode because dean wants to follow
              john’s orders to check out the asylum instead of continuing their search for him<ul>
                <li>it’s later implied sam has complicated feelings toward dean while in his fake therapy session</li>

            <li>sam’s anger is additionally directed at dean because of him trying to control or boss sam around (“and
              dean? he’s your boss?”)<ul>
                <li>dean is acting like john in his absence, so sam’s anger toward john is displaced onto dean who is

              </ul>
            </li>

              brother?”<ul>
                <li>at the end of the episode it’s revealed that dean thinks sam really does hate him enough to kill
                  him, and that the anger ellicott intensified is rooted in something real</li>
                <li>related to the small betrayals dean has perceived from sam over time, and the distance between them
                  that dean sees as abandonment and an absence of love</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>the episode starts with sam being angry that john is jerking them around and then ends with sam picking
              up dean’s phone to hear john on the other line---a tidy loop tying all of sam’s rage to john</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="allegory">Ellicott’s experiments with anger reflect sam’s growing anger and hostility toward john
            (displaced onto dean); sam advocating for the nonviolent patients’ ghosts both reveals his willingness to
            sympathize with monsters and highlights his own inability to give up his anger, contrasting his current
            state with the direction he needs to head toward in order to resolve his issues (letting go of his anger).

            <li>dean is chosen alongside emily as the stand-in sacrifices once dean saves the first couple chosen<ul>
                <li>emily is the black sheep in town, as she’s left out of the goings-on with regards to the vanir.
                  she’s kept in the dark, and as a result has to develop her own sense of self independent from the rest
                  of the town<ul>
                    <li>because of this when dean is questioning the residents, she speaks up against the good of the
                      collective because she doesn’t know better, because she’s developed her own individuality in the
                      absence of being included in the collective, and this otherness that was imposed upon her without
                      her knowledge or consent becomes the scapegoat which leads to her sacrifice</li>
                    <li>sam, like emily, was left out of the family and sheltered from the knowledge that john and dean
                      shared. due to this, he was forced to develop independently from them instead of being subsumed
                      into the collective. he’s forced into an independence he doesn’t want, and then he’s punished for
                      it by being abandoned by his family</li>

            <li>dean mentions that the townspeople are “fattening [the sacrifices] up like a christmas turkey.” could
              parallel the way meg is pushing herself into sam’s good graces before presumably leading him to the
              slaughter---importantly also that she wants to “sacrifice” sam and dean <em>together</em>.</li>
            <li>dean and emily are forced to be sacrifices for a fertility rite, portraying them as lovers who will give
              life to the town (allegory for the family). by paralleling sam and emily through their roles in the story,
              it implies that sam and dean are lovers whose sacrifices can make their family prosper</li>

            <li>emily’s aunt says this exact thing to her when tying her to a tree to be sacrificed to the god</li>
            <li>the vanir harvests the skin from its victims to use for itself, so it is actually “the many” in a very
              literal way<ul>
                <li>additionally the vanir has no distinct personality and doesn’t have much direct screen time as the
                  antagonist. this can also support the collectivism the vanir represents</li>
                <li>the antagonists are also the townspeople as a collective, because they all participate in the ritual
                  murders</li>
              </ul>

                <li>she’s paralleling sam’s conflict of family vs independence</li>
                <li>sam rejects this independence and consequentially meg in order to return to the family</li>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>the case is given to sam and dean by john. dean is willing to follow the orders, but sam is intent to
              follow john to california instead. in the end, sam’s decision is the wrong one, and he falls back in line
              by choosing adherence to family (good of the many) over his own wishes (good of the one)<ul>
                <li>the fact that the god is killed and the town is left to rot at the end of the episode implies that
                  sam and dean choosing family is the ultimately harmful decision, because the decision that saves
                  people is letting the town (family) be destroyed and the decision that kills people is letting the
                  town (family) prosper</li>
                <li>sam stealing a car to find and save dean is indicative of sam falling in line with his family’s
                  values, choosing the family over the self</li>
                <li>sam giving up on california to return to his family is a redemption of 2003 when he gave up on his
                  family to go to california<ul>
                    <li>aunt stacey says “sacrifice means giving up something you love for the greater good”</li>
                    <li>sam gives up what he wants (finding dad and azazel) for the greater good (saving dean and
                      conforming to the family)</li>

            <li>dean accuses sam of being a “selfish bastard” when sam makes to leave for california instead of helping
              the case and ignoring john’s orders<ul>
                <li>“you just do whatever you want. you don’t care what anybody thinks”<ul>
                    <li>sam responds “that’s what you really think?” which dean confirms. relates back to 1.06 skin
                      where the shapeshifter accuses sam of being selfish for leaving dean and forcing him to abandon
                      his own dreams---jealousy</li>
                    <li>later when dean calls sam he apologizes and says sam was right. rewording his first statement:
                      “you’ve always known what you want, and you go after it. you stand up to dad, you always have.
                      hell, i wish i [could do the same]”</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>dean threatens to “leave your ass” when sam starts walking off, mirroring what we know john told sam
                  when sam left for college (1.08 bugs, 1.20 dead man’s blood)<ul>
                    <li>both times, sam is headed for california</li>
                    <li>threats of abandonment and alienation are useful in convincing people to fall in line and
                      conform to the majority</li>
                    <li>the townspeople abandon the annual sacrifices by breaking their car, giving them false
                      directions, leaving them stranded, and ignoring their screams for help</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>dean subverts the theme by letting sam leave, apologizing to sam, and saying he admires sam for his
              willpower to stand up to dad<ul>
                <li>this ironically is what causes sam to return to the family<ul>
                    <li>implies that what sam wants is not actually independence but respect, and he will happily take a
                      destructive family environment as long as he’s respected and included and made to feel like he
                      belongs there</li>
                    <li>sam offers to return during their phone call when he thinks dean is asking for his help---he
                      wants to be wanted and needed</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>dean accepts individuality as an option and sam accepts conformity as an option, which leads them
                  both back into each other’s arms</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>sam and dean both stare at their phones longingly, wanting to call each other, before deciding against
              it<ul>
                <li>indicates that they’re both thinking about the conflict: do i conform or do i rebel?<ul>
                    <li>dean wants to rebel because john betrayed him. he’s clinging onto a sense of normalcy, hoping
                      that john will give him love if he conforms. he wants to be rewarded for being a good son</li>
                    <li>sam wants to conform because he wants a place to belong, but john and dean are denying him of
                      that. sam doesn’t care about independence but rather respect, so as long as he isn’t getting the
                      respect he needs can’t conform to the family and has to make his own decisions</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>harley and stacey jorgeson end up becoming the sacrifices to the vanir at the end of the episode.
              because they represent the motto of the town and therefore john’s teachings, this can represent john being
              sacrificed to sam and dean’s increasingly complicated feelings about family<ul>
                <li>john does end up sacrificing himself for dean in 2.01 in my time of dying. this could be an early
                  indicator of his decision</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <div class="allegory">The townspeople working as a collective represents the winchester value of family
            cohesion, and sam’s reluctance to fall in line and do as he’s told is hurting the family as a whole unit.
