          <h3>Vampires</h3>
          <p>A vampire nest who has killed a hunter (Daniel Elkins) out of revenge for the leader of the nest (Luther).
            They mostly keep a low profile because they’re at risk of extinction, but Elkins’s death puts Sam and Dean
            on their trail. Vampires were previously thought to be extinct (John believed Elkins killed the last one),
            and Dean thought they were entirely fictional.

        </div>

        <div class="theme">Theme: Incest</div>
        <li>the winchesters are likened to this vampire nest, and to vampires in general. they’re a small, tight-knit,
          isolated family of hunters. they’re also somewhat nocturnal, since most of their hunting occurs at night, and
          they have toxic family dynamics. for both vampires and the winchesters, family is their
          <strong>weakness</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>vampires are hunters and are stated to hunt in small packs---this is similar to hunters, implying once
              again that hunting is monstrous: compare 1.02 wendigo, 1.06 skin, 1.14 nightmare, 1.15 the benders</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>the romantic nature of kate and luther’s relationship implies incest within the family dynamic: while luther
          <em>is</em> the patriarch of the nest, there is no evidence that kate is a matriarch and is instead much more
          likely to have been directly turned into a vampire by luther, making their relationship closer to
          parent-child. here, family is equated to sex and romance<ul>
            <li>kate turns jenny into a vampire by coating her own mouth with her blood and then kissing jenny---luther
              “likes to watch,” implying sexual voyeurism. turning a human into a vampire is therefore potentially a sex
              act, either in some or most cases, and definitely here where they’re compared to the winchesters. this
              comes to imply that returning to or embracing the family is an act of sex<ul>
                <li>kate (to dean) “i always like to make new friends”<ul>
                    <li>she says this with sexual overtones, in a flirty voice. again, turning humans into vampires is a
                      sex act, at least for this nest</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>kate = dean and jenny = sam: kate uses her blood to force jenny into her family. the blood inside them
              binds them together. it’s treated as an absolute, immutable, inalienable force in the way it instantly
              changes jenny’s loyalty---she is no longer scared of the vampires and instead embraces them as her family
              <ul>
                <li>blood is symbolically destructive and corrupting, similar to the demon blood in sam’s veins and the
                  familial blood which invites ruin (1.11 scarecrow)</li>
                <li>sam’s demon blood vs sam’s family blood: which is worse? which will destroy him? this episode
                  mirrors his fate vs family conflict through the blood shared between the vampires</li>
                <li>this implies dean is seducing sam via his incestuous desire to return to the family and be loyal to
                  them. jenny is an outsider who is brought into the family as an equal, similar to sam’s journey across
                  season 1: he was outcast from the family and became an “outsider” but returned on equal terms through
                  dean’s persuasion</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>luther “welcome home, baby” to jenny<ul>
                <li>“home” is family in this case, and “baby” is a sexual/romantic endearment. again, family is treated
                  as something sexual here, implying incest within the nest structure. luther is “adopting” jenny into
                  his family, but this is an inherently sexual act shared with kate, her “mother” figure</li>
                <li>this implies an ambiguously incestuous relationship between john, dean, and sam. john has a sexual
                  relationship with dean, and dean has a sexual relationship with sam, which means that john claims
                  (sexual) ownership of sam via dean but is not in direct ownership of him</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>vampires mate for life and are fiercely protective of their kin</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <div class="theme">Theme: Dean Choosing Sam over John</div>
        <li>john demands unquestioning loyalty from his sons. he gets defensive whenever sam questions him and
          undermines his absolute authority<ul>
            <li>when sam asks why the colt is important, john refuses to explain. he expects them to fall in line;
              explanations take too much time, blind obedience is how things get done. this happens again when sam asks
              how john knows he’s picked up the vampires’ trail, and john tells him to “just follow” instead of
              answering</li>
            <li>sam needs to be included as an equal in this dynamic, but john won’t let him. john is a <strong>lone
                wolf</strong>-type character---this style of hunting also manifests in sam during stressful situations
              or when he’s grieving (3.11 mystery spot, 3.16 no rest for the wicked)<ul>
                <li>sam is family-oriented; he wants to belong to his family and he wants everyone to be included.
                  exclusion and ostracization is his biggest fear and concern</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>dean doesn’t trust his own judgment (1.18 something wicked) so he follows john’s orders, exactly as
              expected. this reinforces john’s mindset and justifies the dynamic they’ve fostered<ul>
                <li>dean lacks a sense of self and so clings to others to give him purpose and direction</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>john hounds dean over the state of his car---compare to 1.19 provenance: the impala was dirty and beaten up
          from use<ul>
            <li>john is quick to nitpick and berate and fault-find with his kids: a figure of authority requires
              constant reinforcement of authority. even if your subordinate is perfectly loyal, fault-finding will
              instill fear of reprobation and make them fall back in line and avoid acting out. it maintains a constant
              anxiety that encourages the subordinates to check themselves and find fault on their own so that they’re
              constantly looking to their superior for approval. this could be learned behavior from his time in the
              marines (see later in the episode where he says he “became [their] drill sergeant”)</li>
            <li>dean is the perfect child, according to sam (1.08 bugs), but this shows that no matter how hard dean
              tries to be what john wants him to be, he will inevitably fail. see too 1.18 something wicked: dean lost
              john’s trust after the shtriga attack and never managed to gain it back. this seems to be by design,
              considering how small a nitpick this is---dean is so quick to obey john because he wants to earn his trust
              back; he knows he walks a thin line, and john’s lack of trust in him has perpetuated dean’s lack of trust
              in himself</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>dean “that’s just the way the old man runs things” sam “...maybe that worked when we were kids, but not
          anymore, all right? not after everything we’ve been through, dean”<ul>
            <li>sam <strong>values</strong> the time he’s spent with dean, probably because dean treats him as an equal
              partner and includes him in the decision-making process</li>
            <li>sam “i mean, are you telling me you’re cool with just falling into line and letting him run the whole
              show?” dean “if that’s what it takes”<ul>
                <li>dean hesitates here: he’s faltering in his conviction to follow john blindly now because his
                  development reverse of sam has made him realize (more so) that family is ruin, that independence can
                  be good</li>
                <li>however, he’s still trying to return to innocence. compare 1.16 shadow, where sam won’t commit to
                  his development, and now we see dean not committing to his development, either</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>sam “something big is going down and <strong>we</strong> wanna know what”<ul>
            <li>sam includes dean in this (“we”) despite not having discussed things beforehand. perhaps he correctly
              interpreted dean’s doubts and is therefore speaking for him and defending him because dean won’t or can’t
              do it himself. alternatively, he’s hiding behind dean and using the wall of the collective to avoid the
              full burden of john’s retribution</li>
            <li>sam speaking for dean means that he believes they’re on the same page, or at least he wants them to be.
              compare 12.14 the raid where dean speaks for sam while defending him from mary</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>dean shifts his gaze between john and sam during their fight: he’s gauging their reactions. he pulls sam
          away---it’s the easier and more manageable option to calm sam down than to confront john and defend sam</li>
        <li>dean “that means you, too”<ul>
            <li><strong>this is the exact halfway point in the episode</strong></li>
            <li>dean is finally defying john. the first half of the episode represents the “status quo,” the point of
              origin for their development. sam is angry and defiant, dean is blindly loyal, and john is domineering.
              from here on, though, interactions will reflect their developments. this is marked by dean choosing sam
              over john, standing up to his father for what seems to be the first time and showing him who he has become
              over the past year</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>both sam and john get into their respective cars after dean breaks apart the fight, leaving dean physically
          caught in the middle. he looks helpless---he has to choose between them, and this is represented by the cars.
          he gets into the impala, thus choosing sam<ul>
            <li>notably, the impala is <em>his</em> car: he never had a choice which car he was going to get into. this
              indicates dean never had a choice which person he was going to choose, either---it was always going to be
              sam. narratively he is doomed by sam’s choices (compare 1.11 scarecrow)</li>
            <li>also notably, sam is the one driving the car in this episode. he is physically driving the car just as
              he is narratively driving dean’s story</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>after dean stands up to john, john finally asks if they want to know about the colt. he’s cooled down and
          conceding to reason<ul>
            <li>sam hesitates, deflates, and responds “yes, sir.” this is a comfortable habit he’s willing to fall back
              into now that john is including him: sam is willing to run right back to his family as soon as they
              include him. he <em>wants</em> to be part of the family, possibly more so than dean does. again, his
              exclusion from the family is not his fault</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>dean “you can’t take care of them by yourself” dean “all due respect, but that’s a bunch of crap”<ul>
            <li>he questions john again and stands firm in his conviction because now the status quo is broken and dean
              has chosen sam over john. at the same time, this is a very emotional moment for him: it’s difficult for
              him to break his conditioning and what he once thought were his values</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>sam is uncomfortable and worried when dean defies john. he’s fallen back on his conditioning (“yes, sir”)
          and has become more comfortable following john’s orders now that dean is on his side and has influenced john
          to treat them more as equals<ul>
            <li>sam is okay with dean taking the reigns so long as he’s still included in the decision-making process
              <em>and</em> dean is firmly “on his side.” he doesn’t feel the need to dominate dean or control him; in
              fact he’s more comfortable being led around and following. the stark shift between sam in the first half
              and sam in the second half implies that sam only takes control out of necessity: he’s loud because no one
              will listen to him and he’s desperate to be heard. when he’s being listened to, he’s more prone to
              following orders and letting others take control of the situation while he follows their lead</li>
            <li>dean’s reverse development: sam returns to the family while dean defies the family</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <div class="theme">Theme: Fate VS Family</div>
        <li>john “you walked away” sam “you’re the one who said don’t come back. you closed that door, not me”<ul>
            <li>compare the 1.08 bugs argument</li>
            <li>sam implies he didn’t want to leave the family forever<ul>
                <li>compare 1.01 pilot: the conflict is stanford vs family, sam has to pick between his two homes---he
                  can’t have both, he has to choose between one or the other, there is no middle ground where sam can
                  have his independence <em>and</em> his family</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>john interpreted sam leaving as a betrayal (cheating, infidelity) and burned the bridge. compare 1.11
              scarecrow, where dean uses the same tactic to scare and intimidate sam into staying with him: threaten
              full exclusion (sam’s core fear) to keep the leash short<ul>
                <li>indicates an anxious attachment style, which probably influenced dean’s---<em>and</em> sam’s.
                  compare 1.12 faith (sam refuses to let dean die) and 1.19 provenance (sam refuses to get close to
                  anyone because he’s afraid of losing them)</li>
                <li>all three of them are very all-or-nothing: sam can’t leave and come back; dean has to obey every
                  order; sam can’t date at all because she’ll die; john can’t go off on his own even if it’s safer</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>sam is anxious to be separated from dean, even for mundane things such as dean going to a morgue to secure
          dead man’s blood. he wants to help him and simultaneously ensure his safety. he fears his family dying
          (compare 1.12 faith, 1.19 provenance). this could either be an influence from 1.15 the benders, or it could
          have always been present<ul>
            <li>john, on the other hand, is impassive about dean’s absence. he’s comfortable delegating, indicating that
              he trusts his kids to do what they need to do (or at least he trusts dean) without his micromanaging</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>john “we’re just different” sam “we’re not different. not anymore”<ul>
            <li>consider: does john care about saving people as much as dean does? when they raid the nest, john goes
              immediately for the colt while sam and dean deal with the hostages. this shows john is more concerned with
              the mission than with helping others (and compare 1.18 something wicked, where he abandons a case because
              it put sam in danger: he only really cares about sam and dean’s lives). like sam, he is driven by revenge.
              this could indicate, then, that dean invented the “saving people” part of the mantra for himself, possibly
              as penance for his negligence in 1.18 something wicked<ul>
                <li>compare 1.02 wendigo, 1.12 faith, 1.11 scarecrow, 1.19 provenance</li>
                <li>this means dean is actually the black sheep of the family because vengeance doesn’t move him, and he
                  cares more about helping others than the mission. even when sam dies (2.22 all hell breaks loose, part
                  two), he’s more concerned with bringing him back than with any kind of revenge. compare this to sam in
                  season 4, who drinks demon blood to get strong enough to kill lilith in revenge for taking dean to
                  hell</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <div class="theme">Theme: Family Is a Liability</div>
        <li>john “all i cared about was keeping you boys alive”<ul>
            <li>“alive” being the operative word: they’re less concerned about the quality of life than the mere fact
              that they are alive, and they’re willing to selfishly sacrifice themselves to ensure that, even if it goes
              against what they want. john’s perspective on this could have influenced both sam and dean, who follow in
              his footsteps on this matter over and over again (compare 2.01 in my time of dying, 2.08 crossroad blues,
              2.22 all hell breaks loose, part two, 3.15 time is on my side, 4.09 i know what you did last summer)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>john admits that hunting azazel is a suicide mission. he has been trying to keep sam and dean away because
            he doesn’t want them to see him get hurt or die, and he doesn’t want to see them potentially die either: “i
            can’t watch my children die, too.” compare 2.01 in my time of dying, where he sacrifices himself to azazel
            for dean’s life. he was destined to die on this hunt, and he accepted that long ago which is why he can die
            for dean so easily</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>dean “we’re stronger as a family”</p>
          <ul>
            <li>maybe; but compare 1.11 scarecrow, 1.16 shadow, 3.16 no rest for the wicked: family is weakness, and
              this episode is no exception, since it’s family bonds that become the undoing for the vampire nest as
              well. monsters also know to use family against sam and dean to manipulate them<ul>
                <li>the collective is strong but destructive</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>family is a liability: luther is weak because of his love for kate and so too is the winchester family
              because of their love for each other. dean’s declaration is <strong>wrong</strong>. here dean is blinded
              by sam’s decisions: he lacks agency of his own and comes to parrot sam’s values instead (see 1.16 shadow,
              sam “we should stick together”)<ul>
                <li>dean in 1.06 skin was right. sam’s return to the family is the <strong>wrong choice</strong></li>
                <li>this episode proves the thesis: compare 1.06 skin, 1.11 scarecrow, 1.16 shadow, 1.19 provenance</li>
                <li>the vampires knowingly walk into a trap to save their kin (see 2.10 hunted when ava tells sam he’s
                  walking into a trap, and sam responds “doesn’t matter. it’s my brother”)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>luther grabs sam and uses him as a hostage to threaten dean. it’s a direct parallel to john using kate as
            his hostage. again the vampires are paralleled with the winchesters and proves their loves makes them weak.
            dean can’t let sam get hurt, so he puts down his weapons just like luther did to protect kate. luther’s love
            for kate is romantic, which implies lovers and family are one and the same</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>john “we are stronger as a family”</p>
          <ul>
            <li>directly contradicts the moral of the episode and all of the evidence until now: this choice will lead
              to ruin. compare to 1.11 scarecrow where again they make the decision that runs contrary to the moral<ul>
                <li>as a consequence, john will die and azazel will get the colt (2.01 in my time of dying)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>sam is happy to be included in the family finally :)</li>
            <li>dean seems more reserved about the decision. this could imply his reverse development, or perhaps that
              he’s learned from what he witnessed during their confrontaton with the vampires. he may subconsciously
              recognize that family will lead to ruin and destruction. he’s also not intrinsically motivated to kill
              azazel, and finishing the hunt can still lead to his abandonment, so he has motives that contradict sam
              and john’s</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <div class="allegory">By paralleling the vampire nest with the Winchesters, the incestuous nature of the family
          structure comes to the forefront and allows it to become as a liability for Sam, Dean, and John which
          threatens to undermine their entire mission.</div>

        <div class="theme">Extra Notes</div>
        <li>kate and most of the other vampires don’t know what the colt is or what it can do; luther is seemingly the
          only one who is aware of its power</li>
        <li>dean is still pressuring sam to hook up with sarah---perhaps he approves of her because they’re similar</li>
        <li>sam and dean both search for a new hunt this time---it’s a joint effort now</li>
        <li>they compare daniel elkins’s hunting methods to john’s a lot: this implies john learned from him, possibly
          as an apprentice. john winchester’s journal indicates too that john met elkins on sam’s first birthday, just
          over five months after he started hunting<ul>
            <li>elkins keeps a journal that’s similar to johns: elkins might have shown him how to maximize its
              usefulness, what’s important to note down, etc.</li>
            <li>he uses secret messages (like the PO box) that sam and dean recognize, indicating that john learned the
              style from him. he also might have taught elkins to utilize coordinates as a code for directions, since
              dean mentions in 1.01 pilot that it’s “ex-marine crap”</li>
            <li>john and elkins apparently had a “falling-out” and they haven’t seen each other in years. neither sam
              nor dean are familiar with him, indicating that they probably weren’t taken to see him after the initial
              few visits john made when sam was one and two (john’s journal)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>once john meets up with them, sam and dean take to sleeping on top of the covers on the bed, shows and
          clothes on: this is a high-stress, urgent hunt that requires quick reaction speeds</li>
        <li>john’s kit in his truck is more souped up and swanky compared to the impala: dean is intimidated by it</li>
        <li>sam “what’d you do with the college fund?” john “spent it on ammo”<ul>
            <li>sam laughs at this: he isn’t angry or bitter about this. compare 1.08 bugs and 1.14 nightmare: sam has
              forgiven john for how he was raised. he understands why john did what he did, and the choices he made no
              longer anger sam</li>
